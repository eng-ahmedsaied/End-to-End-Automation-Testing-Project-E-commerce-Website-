End-to-End Automation Testing Project (E-commerce Website)

I’ve recently worked on an E2E automation testing project for an e-commerce website.
The test covers the full user journey — from registration to checkout.

🧩 Scenario steps:
1️⃣ The user registers by entering their details.
2️⃣ Searches for a specific product.
3️⃣ Selects the product and adds it to the cart.
4️⃣ Proceeds to checkout and fills in payment details.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used:

Selenium WebDriver for browser automation

TestNG for test management and assertions

Java as the main programming language

This project helped me improve my understanding of automation flow and synchronization techniques in Selenium.
